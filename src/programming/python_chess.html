		<p>This article was taken from the project's README.md. To view the project in full you can access the
			repository <a href="https://github.com/brighamskarda/python_chess" target="_blank">here</a>. The premise of
			this project was to learn python better by creating a chess engine.</p>
		<p>Two of the initial goals I had with this project were to understand list comprehension better, and
			to do some basic multi-core processing. Additionally I wanted to do some basic machine learning but
			after some initial research I realized I wouldn&#39;t have the time to do that on this project. The
			last
			remnant of this idea is the name of the chess engine file (mlchess.py)</p>
		<p>The first version of the chess engine (commit c3bcd0bd4921c7264403cc0d4f2904589fef890d) was basic
			and would evaluate all possible moves to the same depth. It had no storage structure for the
			calculations it made, and thus it was difficult to prioritize certain lines over others.</p>
		<p>The simple nature of the engine did lend itself easily to the multiprocessing module though. By just
			passing a position to each thread, each thread could operate independently and give the position
			score for its own position.</p>
		<p>While utilizing multiple cores was useful, the lack of a storage structure made it difficult to
			compute specific lines of play. After this commit I made a new version of the chess engine with a
			tree
			structure, where each chess position was a node in the tree, with the parent node be the current
			position on the board, the children being the possible moves that could be made. This allowed me
			to easily traverse through the tree structure and evaluate key moves deeper than others.</p>
		<p>Having a tree structure also allowed the computer to remember lines between moves. When the player
			makes a move, that section of the tree can be kept, while the rest is pruned.</p>
		<p>From there I made many incremental improvements to how the positions are scored and which lines are
			explored. I got it to be decently good against the average human. But there is still much
			improvement to be made.</p>
		<p>The biggest area for improvement is implementing a better min-max algorithm. This is something I
			will be researching in the future.</p>
		<p>Another area for improvement I see is in reducing duplicate positions. If a position is duplicated,
			all references should be pointing to the same place in the tree.</p>
