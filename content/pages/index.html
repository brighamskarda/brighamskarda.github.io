		Welcome to my website. My name is Brigham Skarda and I am currently studying computer science at BYU. Right now
		I am also looking for summer internships within the realm of software engineering. I have a knowledge of Java,
		Python, C/C++ and SQL. I have also been working at BYU's Office of Information Technology for two years. If you
		are a potential employer that has found this website feel free to download my resume by clicking
		<a href="{attach}../downloads/resume.pdf" target="_blank"> <span>here</span></a>. You can also checkout out some

		Besides work related tasks I have many other hobbies. I blog about many of them on this website as well. At the
		top you will see sections for motorcycles, video games, ham radio, technology, and a miscellaneous section where
		I comment on various topics in the world that are interesting to me.
