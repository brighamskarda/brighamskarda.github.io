        <p>Welcome to Brigham Skarda's personal website. Its not particularly fancy, but it's a way for me to write
            about
            topics that are interesting and important to me.</p>
        <p>Go the <a href="/about_me.html">About Me</a> page to get my contact information. Otherwise feel free to
            explore
            my various articles. Most of the content on this website is in a blog-like format.</p>
